          </h2>
          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/70">
            I&apos;m Nikita, a realistic artist who loves creating pencil sketches, canvas paintings, and
            customized outfit designs. I take art commissions and bring emotions to life through detailed
            artwork, inspired by real moments and everyday imagination.
          </p>
          <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-foreground/70">
            After completing my Higher Secondary Education in Arts, I chose to move out of my village to
            chase better opportunities and build a future on my own terms. That decision shaped the way I
            work today—independent, curious, and deeply committed to every piece I create.
